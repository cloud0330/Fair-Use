Millions of users upload videos onto Youtube everyday.  Little do they know that some of them are actually violating the copyright law.  The people who upload videos of their own creation, not based on another person's creation are not violating this law.  However, people who upload videos like lyrics to a song or even a mash-up of other songs are violating this law without even knowing.  Just putting the disclaimer in the information box will not dissolve the claim of copyright.  There _is_ however, a fair use law in effect.  This helps some people with the videos that they have upload onto the internet.  Depending on the artist, some of the copyright laws can be very strict but some are more lenient.  Let us see if [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ380x7qnvE) is breaking any copyright laws, or if it falls under the Fair Use law.  

###Fair Use
Before analyzing if the video is indeed a copyright infringement, what exactly is  Fair Use?  "Fair use is a copyright principle based on the belief that the public is entitled to freely use portions of copyrighted materials for purposes of commentary and criticism" (http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/).  In other words, if one feels the need to criticize an author, he/she can use a portion of their work.  Other than that, copyright owners can take down anything on the internet regarding their work.  However, there are other rules that protect this from happening.

> In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall includeâ€”
> 1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
2. the nature of the copyrighted work
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.    

Under these circumstances, one can determine whether the work the put on the internet is a violation of copyright or if it is under the right of Fair Use.

###Analyzing the Video
So now that the guidelines of Fair Use have been established, let's look at the video again.
|Fair Use Factors|Violation?|Why|
|--------|---------|-------|
|Purpose and Character of Use|Maybe|While the nature of the video is _not for commercial use_, it is also not for educational purposes.
|Nature of copyright work|Maybe||
|The amount used in the video|Maybe|Depending on the nature of the copyright work, the amount that was used in the video may be a violation of Fair Use|
|Effect on the market/value of the copyrighted work|N|Despite the popularity of the maker of the video, it is not making profit on the market.  The song still belongs to the original artist that made them.|

So was this video a violation of copyright?  It depends on how you see it.  I think that it is not a violation of copyright.  Under Fair Use,  it could be seen either way.  It also brings into question of how many of these factors have to be met in order for it to be under the right of Fair Use.  The songs is not making any profit, but at the same time, the maker of the video got enough attention that a music company wanted a contract with him.  

###What's the verdict?
I believe that this mash-up made by Sam Tsui is not a violation of copyright under Fair Use.  The video was put on Youtube and was not used for profit.  He did not make any money by making this video.  He got a lot of fame by posting various music videos on Youtube.  One could argue that because he got a contract with a music recording company that the songs he made were a violation of copyright.  They may be right but the reason he got a contract may be because of the other videos.  I believe that this one is not a violation of copyright but I cannot say that about other videos he made.
